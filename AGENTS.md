### Naming Conventions

- Use conventional commits.
- Use branch prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`.
- Keep generated artifact names short and readable.
- Keep source names consistent with Astro conventions (`pages`, `layouts`, `components`).

## Product

AI code Academy is a public website and blog built with Astro to publish AI and software engineering content.

- Multi-page marketing and educational website.
- Content-driven blog with localized Spanish posts.
- Static-first delivery with SEO-oriented build output.

## Technology

### `/src` Stack

- **Tier**: Frontend (static site generation)
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js runtime for tooling)
- **Framework**: Astro 5
- **Testing**: No automated tests configured yet (`npm run test` is placeholder)
- **Storage**: File-based content in `src/content`
- **Security**: Static deployment model, dependency hygiene, and least-privilege publishing workflow
- **Logging**: Build and runtime logs through Astro CLI and hosting platform logs

- **Development workflow**:
  - Init: `npm install` (or `bun install`)
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Run: `npm run dev` (local), `npm run preview` (built output)
  - Test: `npm run test` (currently placeholder)
  - Lint: Not configured yet; add lint script before enforcing CI lint gate
  - Deploy: Build artifact from `dist/` and publish via repository/hosting pipeline

- **Folder structure**:

- **Agent Skills**:
  - `initialize`: Defines base paths, stack context, and AGENTS bootstrap.
  - `futuristic`: Applies modern, tech-forward design direction for content and UI.

## Principles

1. Think Before Coding  
Surface constraints, trade-offs, and success criteria before implementation.
2. Simplicity First  
Choose the minimal change that solves the problem and keeps maintenance cost low.
3. Surgical Changes  
Edit only the files required for the task and avoid opportunistic refactors.
4. Goal-Driven Execution  
Implement, verify, and report outcomes with clear next actions when gaps remain.
